# Credit Transaction System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the credit transaction system for the time-share exchange platform. The system ensures that credits are properly transferred between users when sessions are completed, with full transaction history tracking.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Credit Transfer Logic

**Problem**: Credits were being transferred when bookings were confirmed, not when sessions were completed.

**Solution**: Modified the `completeBooking` function in `src/lib/skillService.ts` to:
- Transfer credits only when a session is marked as completed
- Use atomic transactions to ensure data consistency
- Create transaction records for both the requester (spent) and provider (earned)

### 2. Fixed Collection Name Inconsistency

**Problem**: Different services were using different collection names (`users` vs `userProfiles`).

**Solution**: Standardized all services to use `userProfiles` collection for consistency.

### 3. Enhanced Transaction History

**Added Functions**:
- `getUserTransactionHistory()` - Get all transactions for a user
- `getUserProfileWithHistory()` - Get user profile with transaction summary
- `completeSessionWithCredits()` - Helper function with proper error handling

### 4. Updated Dashboard Integration

**Changes**: Updated the Dashboard component to use the new `completeSessionWithCredits` function instead of the old `completeBooking` function.

## How It Works

### Session Flow

1. **Booking Creation**: User creates a booking (status: `pending` or `confirmed`)
   - No credits are transferred at this stage
   - Only validates available slots for confirmed bookings

2. **Session Completion**: Provider marks session as completed
   - Credits are transferred from requester to provider
   - Transaction records are created for both users
   - Booking status is updated to `completed`
   - Skill's total sessions counter is incremented

### Credit Transfer Process

When a session is completed:

1. **Validation**: Check if booking status is `confirmed`
2. **Credit Check**: Verify requester has sufficient credits
3. **Atomic Transaction**: 
   - Deduct credits from requester
   - Add credits to provider
   - Create transaction records
   - Update booking status
   - Increment skill session count

### Transaction Records

Each credit transfer creates two transaction records:

**For Requester (Spent)**:
```typescript
{
  fromUserId: requesterId,
  toUserId: providerId,
  skillId: skillId,
  bookingId: bookingId,
  credits: amount,
  type: 'spent',
  description: 'Session completed for [skill name]',
  status: 'completed',
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

**For Provider (Earned)**:
```typescript
{
  fromUserId: requesterId,
  toUserId: providerId,
  skillId: skillId,
  bookingId: bookingId,
  credits: amount,
  type: 'earned',
  description: 'Session completed for [skill name]',
  status: 'completed',
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

## API Functions

### Core Functions

- `completeSessionWithCredits(bookingId, options?)` - Complete session with credit transfer
- `getUserTransactionHistory(userId)` - Get user's transaction history
- `getUserProfileWithHistory(userId)` - Get user profile with transaction summary

### Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validates booking existence and status
- Checks sufficient credits before transfer
- Uses atomic transactions to prevent data corruption
- Returns detailed success/error messages

## Testing

A test file is provided at `src/lib/__tests__/creditTransaction.test.ts` that demonstrates:
- Credit transaction flow
- Booking status validation
- Transaction history verification
- Error handling scenarios

## Database Schema

### Collections Used

- `userProfiles` - User account information and credit balances
- `bookings` - Session bookings with status tracking
- `transactions` - Credit transfer history
- `skills` - Skill information and session counts

### Key Fields

**userProfiles**:
- `credits` - Current credit balance
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

**bookings**:
- `status` - Booking status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled)
- `credits` - Credits required for session
- `completedAt` - Session completion timestamp

**transactions**:
- `type` - Transaction type (earned/spent)
- `status` - Transaction status (completed/cancelled)
- `description` - Human-readable description

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Atomic transactions ensure consistent state
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for all users
3. **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
4. **User Experience**: Clear feedback on transaction status
5. **Scalability**: Efficient queries and real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Real-time transaction notifications
- Credit refund system for cancelled sessions
- Transaction analytics and reporting
- Bulk transaction processing
- Credit expiration system
